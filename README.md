He admits at first glance this may seem like black magic. It certainly raises some questions for you such as :
- does the data sort/group when you go from the button to the report page?
- Is it possible to go from the button to the report page?
- How to do this magic trick ?!

Let's start from the beginning. 

1. BUTTON 

First, go to the Insert section then find the element compartment and select the empty button -> BLANK

After adding our blank, let's change a few settings for it such as : 
- text inside -> button style section 
- add shadow options -> button style section 
- change fill -> button style -> fill section
- and change the background so the colours complement each other -> size and style section 

Effect :

To illustrate the changes made by the button, let's add a KPI in the form of Total Revenue and a stack bar chart total revenue by product category.

2. adding a field for slicers

In the next step we add an empty space for our slicers !

insert section -> elements -> shapes -> rectangle

We format our shape by changing the :

- fill colour -> shape style -> fill
- and border -> shape style -> border

add slicers -> date (choose what you want, in our case it's the date and the countries)
move slicers to the very top : select slicer -> format section -> bring forward
